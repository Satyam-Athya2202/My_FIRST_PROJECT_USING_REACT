       <p>This is my first project using React, and I have been building it while learning the framework. Every day, as I learn new concepts in React, I try to implement them in this project. This hands-on approach helps me understand React better by applying theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios. Whether it's managing state, handling side effects with useEffect.This method not only strengthens my grasp of React but also gives me practical experience, making learning more engaging and effective. </p>
